# nimgnuplot

**LICENSE TBD**

Gnuplot interface for Nim, loosely based on pygnuplot. Originally made for and open sourced by GeoSonics Inc.

nimgnuplot uses a stateful object to accumulate commands, and then execute a script by using an `exec` call to a gnuplot program.

**WORK IN PROGRESS** and not yet ready for use.
